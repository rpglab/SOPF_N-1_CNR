# SOPF
This repo implements four different Stochastic Optimal Power Flow (SOPF) models.

: (i) a relaxed SOPF model that assums infinite network capacity; (ii) a normal SOPF model that enforces base-case network constraints only; (iii) a N-1 SOPF model that enforces both base-case network constraints and contingency-case network constraints; (iv) a N-1 SOPF w. CTS model that implements corrective transmission switching in post-contingency cases beyong the N-1 SOPF model.

Model 1: R-SOPF
(i) a relaxed SOPF model that assums infinite network capacity.

Model 2: N-SOPF
(ii) a normal SOPF model that enforces base-case network constraints only.

Model 3: E-SOPF
(iii) a N-1 SOPF model that enforces both base-case network constraints and contingency-case network constraints.

Model 4: E-SOPFwNR
(iv) a N-1 SOPF w. CTS model that implements corrective transmission switching in post-contingency cases beyong the N-1 SOPF model.
